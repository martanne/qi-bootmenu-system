# Specify Openmoko device to build for (GTA01 or GTA02 which is the default).

# export MACHINE=GTA02

# Link all executables (busybox, kexec, dropbear statically)

# export STATIC=1

# Link qi-bootmenu against shared libraries

# export QI_BOOTMENU_SHARED=1

# Build with debug flags

# export DEBUG=1

# Leave source in build/temp-$ARCH after build.

# export NO_CLEANUP=1

# Do not strip executables useful for debugging

# export NO_STRIP=1

# Tell the linux kernel, uClibc, and busybox to show the actual build commands
# instead of pretty-print output.

# If this is set, try downloading packages from this location first.

# export PREFERRED_MIRROR=http://impactlinux.com/fml/mirror

# Set this to use symlinks instead of hard links when creating temporary copies
# of the source packages (in setupfor).  This is slower and uses more inodes,
# but allows the extracted source packages to live in a different filesystem
# than the build directory.

# export SNAPSHOT_SYMLINK=1
