# Setup

# This file is a place for you to set configuration values.  This entire
# file is optional; by default all the variables documented in this file
# are left blank by the build.  Feel free to replace this file with your
# own version, or to set these as environment variables on the command line.

# If this is set, the build records the command lines run by each build into
# log files in the build directory, ala "build/cmdlines.$PACKAGENAME"

# export RECORD_COMMANDS=1

# This may be set by the target's "details" file, but you can override it here.
# You can set it to ext2, initramfs, or squashfs.  It defaults to squashfs
# if blank.

# export SYSIMAGE_TYPE=ext2

# Set this to use symlinks instead of hard links when creating temporary copies
# of the source packages (in setupfor).  This is slower and uses more inodes,
# but allows the extracted source packages to live in a different filesystem
# than the build directory.

# export SNAPSHOT_SYMLINK=1

# If this is set, try downloading packages from this location first.

# export PREFERRED_MIRROR=http://impactlinux.com/fml/mirror

# Try development versions of these packages.  (Know what you're doing if
# you select these, it's quite possible the result won't work.)

# export USE_UNSTABLE=uClibc,busybox,linux

# Debugging option to leave source in build/temp-$ARCH after build.
# export NO_CLEANUP=1

# Do not strip executables useful for debugging
# export NO_STRIP=1

# Tell the linux kernel, uClibc, and busybox to show the actual build commands
# instead of pretty-print output.

# export BUILD_VERBOSE=1

# Create a tarball with the files installed by each individual package at
# each stage of the build.

# export BINARY_PACKAGE_TARBALLS=1
